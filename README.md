# Truman Benjamin

Hello, GitHub! 👋

I'm Truman Benjamin, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho pursuing a degree in software engineering. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- I'm currently a senior studying web development. 
- My long-term goal is to begin my own company building premium, custom designed websites for clients. This is a passion of mine and something I am actively working towards. I love the design aspect of web development, and have done my best over the past year or so to dive into this and take in all that I can! 

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in: HTML, CSS & Javascript. I have experience in both frontend and backend web development- I prefer frontend because of my interest in design, but I enjoy exploring the logic necessary for backend development.
